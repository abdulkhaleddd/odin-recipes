<h3>Recipe</h3>
<ol>
    <li><p1>Combine water, light corn syrup, and granulated sugar in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.</p1><p2>Stir until the sugar is moistened and dissolves.</p2></li>
    <li><p1>Brush down the sides of the pan with a wet pastry brush â€“ this will remove any stray sugar crystals. Sugar crystals in the pan can cause your whole batch to crystallize. </p1><p2>Once it comes to a boil, insert a candy thermometer. From this point on, do not stir the candy.</p2></li>
    <li><p1>Cook the candy until it reaches 290 F on the thermometer. It should be a light yellowish color.</p1><p2>Immediately remove the pan from the heat. Let it sit for a minute, until the rapid bubbling stops, then add flavoring extract and blue gel food coloring.</p2> <p3>Stir well until the color is evenly distributed.</p3></li>
    <li><p1>Pour the hot candy out onto a baking sheet covered with foil. You can spread it into a thinner layer with the spatula if you would like.</p1> <p2>Let the candy cool completely at room temperature, until it is set and hard.</p2><p3>Use a knife or kitchen mallet to smash it up into smaller pieces.</p3></li>
